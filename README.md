# Netflix.Analysis_Dashboard_Tableau_Project
My observations about the Netflix dashboard are excellent and provide valuable insights. 
It's clear that the United States is the leading producer of content in your library. 
The "TV-MA" rating is the most common, indicating a mature audience preference. 
Documentaries and stand-up comedy are the top genres, reflecting user interest. Additionally, the data suggests that Netflix has been prioritizing the addition of movies over TV shows, with a significant increase in movie titles in 2018 and 2019, making movies the majority of content available on the platform.

In terms of title count, movies significantly outnumber TV shows, constituting approximately 62.42% of the content library compared to 31.58% for TV shows. These insights shed light on content preferences and Netflix's content strategy, emphasizing their shift towards movie content. This information can inform strategic decisions and content recommendations to better serve users.
